"It may be said that there is already a sufficiency of books on the one-"

"*Shooting to Live* describes methods developed and practiced during an "
"eventful quarter of a century and adopted, in spite of their unorthodoxy,"
" by one police organisation after another in the Far East and elsewhere. "
"It is the authors' hope that their relation of these methods may "
"contribute to the efficiency, and therefore safety, of those whose lot it"
" is to use the one-hand gun in the course of duty."

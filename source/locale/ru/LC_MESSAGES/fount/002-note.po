"The toughest city in the world was Shanghai. The time was the 1930s. The "
"streets were ruled by gangs. Violent gang wars, murder, rape, and robbery"
" were The order of the day. The night belonged to roaming gangs of "
"toughs. In charge of the Shanghai Municipal Police, Capt. W. E. Fairbairn"
" and his partner, Capt. Eric Anthony Sykes, were determined to reclaim "
"the streets for the citizenry."

"*Shooting to Live* is the product of Fairbairn's and Syke's *practical* "
"experience with the handgun. Hundreds of incidents provided the basis for"
" the first true book on life-or-death shootouts with the pistol. "
"*Shooting to Live* teaches, in clear, concise terms, all concepts, "
"considerations, and applications of *combat pistolcraft*. The methods "
"taught here provided the basis for all the later masters---Applegate, "
"Weaver, Cooper, Taylor, Chapman, Farnham, Hackathorn, et al. This all-"
"time classic book on combat pistol shooting is a must for the serious "
"shooter."

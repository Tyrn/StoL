"By \"Pistol\" is meant any one-hand gun. This book is concerned with two "
"types only: (1) pistols with revolving cylinders carrying several "
"cartridges, and (2) self-loading magazine pistols. For convenience, the "
"former will be referred to henceforth as \"revolvers\" and the latter as "
"\"automatics.\" The word \"revolver\" has long been accepted by "
"dictionaries in almost every language. If \"automatic\" has not yet been "
"quite so widely accepted, it is, we think, well on the way to being so, "
"and we shall not be anticipating matters unduly if we continue to use it "
"in the sense indicated."

"Excluding duelling (since it is forbidden in most countries and appears "
"to be declining in favour even in those countries in which it is "
"permitted tacitly or otherwise), there seem to remain two primary and "
"quite distinct uses for the pistol. The first of those uses is for target"
" shooting (i.e. *deliberate* shooting with a view to getting all shots in"
" the ten-ring on a stationary target). Its second use is as a weapon of "
"combat."

"This book is concerned solely with the latter aspect, but it must not be "
"inferred on that account that we in any way decry the sport of target "
"shooting. On the contrary, we admire the high degree of skill for which "
"it calls and which we personally cannot emulate. We recognise the great "
"amount of patient practice necessary to attain such skill, and we can see"
" that in suitable circumstances the inclusion of a target pistol in the "
"camper's equipment would not only be a source of pleasure but might be "
"useful as well. Target shooting has its place and we have no quarrel with"
" it."

"There probably will be a quarrel, however, when we go on to say that "
"beyond helping to teach care in the handling of fire-arms, target "
"shooting is of no value whatever in learning the use of the pistol as a "
"weapon of combat. The two things are as different from each other as "
"chalk from cheese, and what has been learned from target shooting is best"
" unlearned if proficiency is desired in the use of the pistol under "
"actual fighting conditions."

"These views are the outcome of many years of carefully recorded "
"experience with the Police Force of a semi-Oriental city in which, by "
"reason of local conditions that are unusual and in some respects unique, "
"armed crime flourishes to a degree that we think must be unequalled "
"anywhere else in the world. That experience includes not only armed "
"encounters but the responsibility for instructing large numbers of police"
" in those methods of pistol shooting which have been thought best "
"calculated to bring results in the many shooting affrays in which they "
"are called upon to take part."

"There are many who will regard our views as rank heresy, or worse. We "

"At this point it would be advisable to examine very carefully the "
"conditions under which we may expect the pistol to be used, regarding it "
"only as a combat weapon. Personal experience will tend perhaps to make us"
" regard these conditions primarily from the policeman's point of view, "
"but a great many of them must apply equally, we think, to military and "
"other requirements in circumstances which preclude the use of a better "
"weapon that the pistol---that is to say, when it is impracticable to use "
"a shot-gun, rifle of sub-machine gun."

"In the great majority of shooting affrays the distance at which firing "
"takes place is not more than four yards. Very frequently it is "
"considerably less. Often the only warning of what is about to take place "
"is a suspicious movement of an opponent's hand. Again, your opponent is "
"quite likely to be on the move. It may happen, too, that you have been "
"running in order to overtake him. If you have had reason to believe that "
"shooting is likely, you will be keyed-up to the highest pitch and will be"
" grasping your pistol with almost convulsive force. If you have to fire, "
"your instinct will be to do so as quickly as possible, and you will "
"probably do it with a bent arm, possibly even from the level of the hip. "
"The whole affair may take place in a bad light of none at all, and that "
"is precisely the moment when the policeman, at any rate, is most likely "
"to meet trouble, since darkness favours the activities of the criminal. "
"It may be that a bullet whizzes past you and that you will experience the"
" momentary stupefaction which is due to the shock of the explosion at "
"very short range of the shot just fired by your opponent---a very "
"different feeling, we can assure you, from that experienced when you are "
"standing behind or alongside a pistol that is being fired. Finally, you "
"may find that you have to shoot from some awkward position, not "
"necessarily even while on your feet."

"There is no exaggeration in this analysis of fighting conditions. Here we"
" have a set of circumstances which in every respect are absolutely "

"To answer this question, we must consider the essential points which "
"emerge from our analysis. They appear in the following order:---"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/fount/01-purposes-of-the-pistol.rst:127
msgid "Extreme speed, both in drawing and firing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/fount/01-purposes-of-the-pistol.rst:128
msgid "Instinctive, as opposed to deliberate aim."

"Practice under circumstances which approximate as nearly as possible to "
"actual fighting conditions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/fount/01-purposes-of-the-pistol.rst:132
msgid ""
"In commenting on the first essential, let us say that the necessity for "
"speed is vital and can never be sufficiently emphasised. The average "
"shooting affray is a matter of split seconds. If you take much longer "
"than a third of a second to fire your first shot, you will not be the one"
" to tell the newspapers about it. It is literally a matter of the quick "
"and the dead. Take your choice."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/fount/01-purposes-of-the-pistol.rst:141
msgid ""
"Instinctive aiming, the second essential, is an entirely logical "
"consequence of the extreme speed to which we attach so much importance. "
"That is so for the simple reason that there is no time for any of the "
"customary aids to accuracy. If reliance on those aids has become "
"habitual, so much the worse for you if you are shooting to live. There is"
" no time, for instance, to put your self into some special stance or to "
"align the sights of the pistol, and any attempt to do so places you at "
"the mercy of a quicker opponent. In any case, the sights would be of "
"little use if the light were bad, and none at all if it were dark, as "
"might easily happen. Would it not be wiser, therefore, to face facts "
"squarely and set to work to find out how best to develop instinctive "
"aiming to the point of getting results under combat conditions?"

"Everyone is familiar with the fact that he can point his forefinger "
"accurately at an object at which he happens to be looking. It is just as "
"easy, moreover, to do so without raising the hand so high as the level of"
" the eyes. That he can do so may be coordination of eye and hand or just "
"plain instinct, call it what you will."

"Please try this little experiment while sitting at your desk. Imagine "
"that you are holding a pistol in your right hand. Sitting squarely and "
"keeping both eyes open, raise your hand from the level of the desk, but "
"not so high as the level of your eyes, and with a straight arm point your"
" extended forefinger at a mark directly in front of you on the opposite "
"wall. Observe carefully now what has taken place. Your forefinger, as "
"intended, will be pointing to the mark which you are facing squarely, and"
" the back of your hand will be vertical, as it would be if it actually "
"held a pistol. You will observe also that you have brought your arm "
"across you until your hand is approximately in alignment with the "
"vertical centre-line of your body and that, under the directing impulse "
"of the master-eye, your hand will be bent from the wrist towards the "

"The elements of that little experiment form the basis of the training "
"system which is elaborated in succeeding chapters. We cannot claim that "
"the system produces nail-driving marksmanship, but that is not what we "
"look for. We want the ability to hit with extreme speed man-sized targets"
" at very short ranges under the difficult circumstances which have been "

"In this training system nothing is permitted to interfere with the "
"development of speed. For that reason we have steadily set our faces "
"against competitions or rewards of any kind. The instant that "
"competitions, with the accompanying medals, badges, etc. are introduced, "
"men will try to shoot deliberately, whether consciously or not and we "

"For long shots, and they are necessary occasionally, different methods "
"must be employed; but even for long shots speed must still be regarded as"
" essential, and any tendency to deliberate shooting should be discouraged"
" by such means as the exposure of the targets for very brief periods "

"The theories involved in the square stance, the position of the pistol in"
" line with the vertical centre of the body, and the hand bent over to the"
" right have proved in practice to be of immense assistance in the "
"development of the desired standard of accuracy when shooting at speed. "
"Though still very willing to learn, the authors doubt now whether any "
"other methods would answer the particular purposes in view. In general, "
"the training system given in this book may fairly be said to have "
"achieved its object, but perhaps it is time now for the promised "
"statistics to play their part in the discussion."

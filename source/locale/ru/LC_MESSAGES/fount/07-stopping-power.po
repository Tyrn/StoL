"We approach this subject with considerable diffidence. We regard it as "
"essentially one in which theory should be discarded in favour of "
"practice, but even practice, as evidenced in carefully noted records over"
" a number of years, does not lead us to any finality in the matter. "
"Instead, it provides us with so many contradictions that we feel that "
"anything approaching dogmatism would be most unwise."

"To clear the ground for discussion we can eliminate at once the .22's and"
" .25's, leaving only the larger calibres available in modern revolvers "
"and automatic pistols. Those will be calibres .32, .38 and .45, or "
"approximately those sizes."

"We were brought up in the belief that a heavy bullet of soft lead, "
"travelling in the leisurely manner of bygone days, could not be improved "
"upon if it was desired to dispose of one's human foes in a decisive and "
"clean-cut manner. We believed that such a bullet would mushroom, and that"
" even if it did not do so, the impact of such a formidable mass of lead "
"would infallibly do all that was required, including knocking the enemy "
"clean off his feet."

"We also believed that bullets of approximately equal weight, jacketed "
"with cupro-nickel and travelling at perhaps a greater velocity, provided "
"penetration as opposed to shock and were therefore unsuited to their "
"purpose; and we had no faith whatever in light bullets driven at a much "
"higher velocity, unless they could be so made as to secure effective "
"expansion shortly after impact. Expanding bullets, however, are barred by"
" the rules of the game as we have had to play it, so for practical "
"purposes we must confine ourselves to solid bullets."

"We are not so sure now of these beliefs. Perhaps the reasons for our "

"on the subject was carefully sifted at the time and nothing has been "

"We shall choose for our first instance one relating to the big lead "
"bullet driven at a moderate velocity. On this occasion, a Sikh constable "
"fired six shots with his .455 Webley at an armed criminal of whom he was "
"in pursuit, registering five hits. The criminal continued to run, and so "
"did the Sikh, the latter clinching the matter finally bu battering in the"
" back of the criminal's head with the butt of his revolver. Subsequent "
"investigations showed that one bullet only, and that barely deformed, "
"remained in the body, the other four having passed clean through."

"A very similar incident took place more recently---though it relates to a"
" different weapon. A European patrol-sergeant, hearing shooting and "
"shouts of \"Ch'iang-Tao\" (robber), rushed to a rice shop which seemed to"
" be the centre of the tumult, and there saw an armed Chinese robbing the "
"till. The Chinese immediately opened fire on the sergeant with an "
"automatic pistol at about 6 yards, firing several shots until his pistol "
"jammed. Fortunately none of the shots took effect, and meanwhile the "
"sergeant returned the fire swiftly and effectively with a .45 Colt "
"automatic, commencing at about 10 feet and firing his sixth and last shot"
" at 3 feet as he rapidly closed in on his opponent. Later, it was found "
"that of those six shots, four had struck fleshy parts of the body, "
"passing clean through, while one bullet remained in the shoulder and "
"another had lodged near the heart. Yet, in spite of all this, the robber "
"was still on his feet and was knocked unconscious by the butt of the "
"sergeant's pistol as he was attempting to escape by climbing over the "
"counter. Here we have two heavy jacketed bullets which did not waste "
"their substance on mere penetration, on of them inflicting a wound which "
"came near to being fatal. In theory these two heavy bullets should have "
"stopped toe man in his tracks, but the facts are as related. Can anyone "
"explain?"

"Descending in the scale of calibres and bullet weights, the only record "
"we have of a man dropping instantly when shot relates to the performance "
"of a .380 Colt automatic (pocket model). In this instance a single bullet"
" penetrated from front to back, lodging very near the spine. The victim "
"nevertheless recovered himself quickly and was able to get on his feet "
"again. We think this case is probably analogous to the numerous instances"
" that big-game hunters will recall of animals dropping instantly to neck "
"shots that just miss the vertebra, only to get up again a few moments "
"after and disappear over the horizon."

"Turning now to the high velocity small calibre weapons, we have seen "
"terrible damage caused by a Mauser automatic, calibre 7.63 mm., of "
"military pattern. We have in mind the case of a man who was hit in the "
"arm by a solid full-jacketed bullet from a weapon of this type. Though he"
" was in hospital within half an hour of being shot, nothing could be done"
" to avoid amputation, so badly were the bone and tissue lacerated. "
"Perhaps \"pulped\" would convey our meaning more exactly. Yet in theory "
"at least the bullet should have caused far less shock than it obviously "
"did. From what we have read, the bullet had something of the effect that "
"the latest developments in ultra high velocity small-bore rifles are "
"reported to have on game animals. We might add that in the particular "
"service from whose records we have been quoting, nothing is so feared, "
"rightly or wrongly, as the Mauser military automatic. The mention of the "
"word is sufficient, if there is trouble afoot, to send men in instant "
"search of bullet-proof equipment."

"We have tried to solve by experiment this question of the knock-down "
"blow, but there is no satisfactory way of doing it. The nearest we have "
"come to it has been to allow ourselves to be shot at while holding a "
"bullet-proof shield. The chief value of that experiment was a conclusive "
"demonstration of the efficacy of the shield."

"Nevertheless, it did enable us to form some idea of the disconcerting "
"effect of the explosion when a pistol is fired at one at very short "
"range. These experiments with bullet-proof shields amount to no more than"
" the firing of various types of bullets at a very hard surface of "
"considerable area, flexibly supported, *i.e.* by the arm. The shock of "
"impact increased in proportion to the velocity of the bullets but in all "
"cases was negligible, the supporting arm only recoiling minutely. The "
"results to the bullets were exactly what might have been expected. Soft "
"lead bullets at low velocity mushroomed perfectly, jacketed bullets at "
"moderate velocity broke into sizable and greatly deformed fragments, "
"while high velocity jacketed bullets practically disintegrated. But if "
"the firing had been against a human body instead of a shield, it would "
"not be wise to conclude either that the shock of impact would have been "
"so slight or that the various bullets would have behaved exactly as they "
"did."

"Other tests, carried out by firing into wood of varied thickness and "

"These little experiments left us, however, with a query which we have not"
" been able to answer. How much, if anything, of deformation or "
"disintegration is due to the sudden arrestation of the rotary motion when"
" bullets are fired from a rifled barrel at objects hard enough to resist "
"them effectively?"

"To sum up, all that we have done in this chapter is to provide instances "
"of how various types of weapons and their loads have not run true to "
"form. Preconceived ideas, based on theory or perhaps hearsay, seem to "
"have been upset. We say \"seem\" advisedly, for in spite of the length "
"and variety of our records we do not consider that we have had, even yet,"
" sufficient visual proof of the behaviour and effects of bullets fired in"
" human targets to enable us to lay down any hard-and-fast rules."

"We do not know that a big soft lead bullet will not have the knock-down "
"effect generally claimed. All we can say is that we have never seen it. "
"We do not know for certain, either, that a full-jacketed high-velocity "
"small-calibre bullet will always have the effect described in the "
"particular instance which we have given."

"We incline to the belief that the human factor must influence to some "
"extent the behaviour of bullets. A pugilist at the top of his form can "
"stand vastly more punishment than a man who is \"soft\" and untrained. "
"Capacity to resist shock and pain appears to be also a function of the "
"nervous system, and marked differences occur in this respect as between "
"individuals of different races. Perhaps that partially explains why some "
"men are not knocked out by bullets when they ought to be. Again, if a "
"bullet caught a man off balance, might not that aid in producing the "
"appearance of a knock-down blow?"

"We have made no mention yet of an aspect of this matter which we have "
"observed time after time in the course of years. A hit in the abdominal "
"region almost invariably causes a man to drop anything he may have in his"
" hands and to clutch his stomach convulsively. We may add that such a hit"
" almost always has fatal results, and that is an excellent reason for "
"such equipment as effective bullet-proof vests, at least for the use of "
"police."

"If the ideal to be attained is a weapon that, with a body shot alone, "
"will drop a man in his tracks with absolute certainty, then there is "
"something lacking in the best of modern revolvers and automatics. It "
"could be done, doubtless, with a weapon of greatly increased calibre and "
"power, but the added weight and size of such a weapon would almost "
"certainly render it unsuitable for average requirements. So perhaps we "
"shall have to make the best of such weapons as are available to us."

"As regards the second requirement the reader will have gathered from "
"Chapters III and IV on training that we have a preference for firing in "
"\"bursts\" of two or more shots. We think that lack of stopping power "
"inherent in the cartridge is compensated for in some degree by the added "
"shock of two or more shots in very rapid succession. Medical evidence "
"tends to confirm this belief, which is strengthened moreover by the "
"evidences we have seen of the terribly destructive effects on human "
"targets of submachine-guns of the Thompson type. Obviously, this belief "
"of ours implies the necessity for a large volume of fire, quite apart "
"from the desirability on other grounds of having as many rounds as "
"possible at one's disposal without having to reload."

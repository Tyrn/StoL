"Generally speaking, the private individual owning a good pistol is too "

"In the Services, however, matters are rather different. Of necessity, "
"very often, weapons are subjected to rough treatment, and it may happen "
"that the most careful man may drop his pistol by accident. If it is made "
"clear to the men that such accidents are not regarded as punishable "
"offences, they will be far more apt to report them quickly and to ensure "
"that their weapons, on which their lives may depend, are put as soon as "
"possible into serviceable condition once more. We are not legislating for"
" the man who commits wilful damage or the genius in whose hands "
"everything comes to pieces quite naturally. Men of that kind do not, or "
"should not, go very far without being recognised for what they are, and "
"there are suitable and well-established methods of dealing with them."

"Accident and ill-usage can have deplorable effects on revolvers in the "
"way of broken firing pins, damaged pawls or cylinder ratchets and bent "
"cranes, the last mentioned giving rise to much more trouble than is "
"commonly supposed. Dropping the gun on to a hard surface is often "
"sufficient to put the crane out of alignment, even though there is no "
"visible damage done, and no overhaul of a revolver is complete unless the"
" alignment of the crane is verified by the application of the requisite "
"armourer's gauge. Then, too, there is the fact that barrel catch-springs,"
" if of the flat or leaf variety, break far more frequently than they "
"should, and it is surprising that manufacturers continue to fit them when"
" it is a perfectly simple matter to substitute coil springs, which would "
"be much more reliable."

"An automatic of good make is much less liable than a revolver to damage "
"from being dropped on a hard surface. The few instances of cracked slides"
" are due, not to the weapon being dropped, but to long use in rapid fire,"
" such as might be the case with a pistol used by an instructor. "
"Nevertheless, a fall may damage the hammer and sights or may loosen pins "
"and screws."

"Otherwise, there is little about the pistol itself that is liable to "

"We have to admit that in the beginning we paid little attention to the "
"magazines or their condition. We soon noticed, however, that some of the "
"magazines in our charge were getting rusty and that others, if not rusty,"
" were clogged up with tobacco dust, fluff and bits of matches, the sort "
"of stuff that is found in most men's pockets. We took the hint and, as "
"opportunity served, had every one of some 9000 magazines stripped and "
"cleaned. The rust was removed, together with astonishing quantities of "
"the stuff referred to above, and, more important still, the overhaul "
"served to reveal a certain amount of damage due to hard knocks and wear "
"and tear. The only sensible thing to do was to recognise at once the wear"
" and tear that existed, and would continue to exist, in an arduous "
"service, the conditions of which could not be modified, and then to apply"
" the remedy of periodic overhauls. It has long been our custom, "
"therefore, to have every pistol, with its two magazines, sent to the "
"armoury for inspection at intervals of six months, regardless of whether "
"or not any defects are apparent. On these occasions, not only do the "
"pistols receive whatever attention is necessary, but, as part of the "
"routine, the magazines are stripped and cleaned (reblued if they need "
"it), the springs are greased and, if found necessary, dents are removed "
"from the shells, base plates are straightened out and splayed sides "
"replaced in position, the completed job having to measure up to gauges "
"specially constructed for each essential dimension. The results of these "
"periodic overhauls have been entirely satisfactory and jambs are now of "
"rare occurrence."

"Enough has been said to show that the condition of the magazine is of the"
" utmost importance to the reliable functioning of the pistol and at least"
" ordinary care, therefore, should be exercised it its regard. Those "
"individuals who use their magazines as screwdrivers, or to open beer "
"bottles, have no one to blame but themselves when their pistols refuse to"
" function. If any doubt exists as to its condition, a magazine should be "
"regarded as defective until competent inspection is available. If the "
"doubt is confirmed, competent inspection will include a rapid-fire test "
"with the magazine charged to full capacity. A worthwhile precaution, to "
"keep the spring efficient, is to remove one or two cartridges whenever "
"circumstances permit. This applies, of course, to conditions which "
"necessitate the magazine being kept charged more or less permanently. "
"Properly treated, there is no reason why a well-made magazine should not "
"last twenty years."

"No ammunition can be expected to withstand indefinitely the wear and tear"

"Our conclusions in the matter are based upon the exigencies of the police"
" service of a great city, a service that functions ceaselessly for "
"twenty-four hours a day and is maintained by large numbers of men whom "
"circumstances compel to go armed with pistols. For a portion of the "
"force, economy demands a ratio of approximately two weapons to three men."
" It is plain that the same men cannot be on duty all the time and it "
"follows that in the course of twenty-four hours weapons and ammunition "
"must be returned at intervals to police stations for subsequent issue to "
"other men going out on duty. Such \"change-overs,\" as they are known "
"technically, occur not less than three times in twenty-four hours. At "
"each \"change-over\" safety demands that the weapons be unloaded, only to"
" be reloaded on issue to the next men. Apart from the \"change-overs,\" "
"which are due to motives of economy, it will be recognised, too, that "
"event in those cases where weapons are provided for each individual, a "
"certain amount of loading and unloading is likely to take place in the "
"interests of safety. Add now the fact, mentioned already, that the "
"ammunition is carried in all weathers and we have a set of circumstances "
"definitely indicative of hard usage."

"Careful records of over fifteen years show that under these circumstances"
" the extreme length of time for which automatic pistol ammunition can be "

"The loading and unloading of revolvers imply much more handling of the "
"ammunition than is the case with automatic pistols, which carry their "
"ammunition in box magazines. Here the magazines receive most of the rough"
" treatment. With all the care in the world we must expect, too, that "
"occasionally ammunition will be dropped on the ground, possibly on the "
"unsympathetic cement floor of a police station. Such treatment has less "
"effect on automatic pistol ammunition, with its tightly crimped jacketed "
"bullets, than on revolver cartridges, particularly those of large calibre"
" carrying soft lead bullets. While there may be no noticeable deformation"
" of the latter, they are more liable to be jarred loose from the crimping"
" and that is the prelude to other troubles."

"Apart from what may be regarded as inherent disadvantages in revolver "
"ammunition, careful comparisons of respective measurements incline us to "
"the belief that very often somewhat less care is exercised in its "
"manufacture than is the case with automatic pistol ammunition. Of sheer "
"necessity, the latter must conform more rigidly to accepted standards. "
"Too great a departure from standard would be revealed very quickly by the"
" automatic action of the weapon in which it is used, a compelling factor "
"in the production of reliable ammunition. It is only fair to add that "
"defects in the automatic ammunition put out by makers of repute are few "

"The \"life\" of ammunition is a matter which merits the most careful "

"not to trust to reserve supplies kept in stock for a number of years but "

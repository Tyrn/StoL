V. Pistol and Cartridge
=======================

- Mechanical defects.
- Cartridge defects.
- Care of ammunition.
- Supplies, current requirements
  and reserve stocks of ammunition.

This chapter relates only to the products of
manufacturing concerns of good standing and with
well-deserved reputations which they are not likely
to hazard. There are plenty of the other kind of
manufacturer but with them we have nothing to do
beyond remarking that it is due to their existence
that many criminals have been brought to justice
and the lives of many policemen have been saved.

The modern one-hand gun and its ammunition
have been brought to such a state of perfection that,
assuming reasonable care in their use, malfunctions
of the former and defects in the latter are of rare
occurrence.

The great majority of malfunctions of the modern
pistol are due, not to faults in design or manufacture,
but to ignorance, neglect or rough handling, accidental
or otherwise, on the part of the user.

Generally speaking, the private individual owning
a good pistol is too much of a "gun-crank" to be
guilty of wilful neglect or rough handling and to
him it is superfluous to recommend that, in case of
accident, his pistol should be promptly overhauled
by a competent armourer.

In the Services, however, matters are rather
different. Of necessity, very often, weapons are
subjected to rough treatment, and it may happen
that the most careful man may drop his pistol by
accident. If it is made clear to the men that such
accidents are not regarded as punishable offences,
they will be far more apt to report them quickly
and to ensure that their weapons, on which their
lives may depend, are put as soon as possible into
serviceable condition once more. We are not legislating
for the man who commits wilful damage or
the genius in whose hands everything comes to
pieces quite naturally. Men of that kind do not,
or should not, go very far without being recognised
for what they are, and there are suitable and well-established
methods of dealing with them.

As far as our experience goes, a comparison between
the automatic and the double-action revolver, in
respect of their liability to damage, results in favour
of the former.

Accident and ill-usage can have deplorable effects
on revolvers in the way of broken firing pins, damaged
pawls or cylinder ratchets and bent cranes, the last
mentioned giving rise to much more trouble than is
commonly supposed. Dropping the gun on to a
hard surface is often sufficient to put the crane out
of alignment, even though there is no visible damage
done, and no overhaul of a revolver is complete
unless the alignment of the crane is verified by the
application of the requisite armourer's gauge. Then,
too, there is the fact that barrel catch-springs, if of
the flat or leaf variety, break far more frequently
than they should, and it is surprising that manufacturers
continue to fit them when it is a perfectly
simple matter to substitute coil springs, which would
be much more reliable.

An automatic of good make is much less liable
than a revolver to damage from being dropped on
a hard surface. The few instances of cracked slides
are due, not to the weapon being dropped, but to
long use in rapid fire, such as might be the case
with a pistol used by an instructor. Nevertheless,
a fall may damage the hammer and sights or may
loosen pins and screws.

The extractors and ejectors occasionally give
trouble, but this is usually due to wear after very
long use.

Otherwise, there is little about the pistol itself
that is liable to damage. We must look, rather,
to its magazine for the cause of 90 per cent. of
the troubles which we used to encounter, and in
this connection we shall relate our own experiences
in the care and maintenance of large numbers of
automatic pistols having magazines of the detachable
type.

We have to admit that in the beginning we paid
little attention to the magazines or their condition.
We soon noticed, however, that some of the magazines
in our charge were getting rusty and that others,
if not rusty, were clogged up with tobacco dust,
fluff and bits of matches, the sort of stuff that is
found in most men's pockets. We took the hint
and, as opportunity served, had every one of some
9000 magazines stripped and cleaned. The rust
was removed, together with astonishing quantities
of the stuff referred to above, and, more important
still, the overhaul served to reveal a certain amount
of damage due to hard knocks and wear and tear.
The only sensible thing to do was to recognise at
once the wear and tear that existed, and would
continue to exist, in an arduous service, the conditions
of which could not be modified, and then to apply
the remedy of periodic overhauls. It has long been
our custom, therefore, to have every pistol, with its
two magazines, sent to the armoury for inspection
at intervals of six months, regardless of whether or
not any defects are apparent. On these occasions,
not only do the pistols receive whatever attention
is necessary, but, as part of the routine, the magazines
are stripped and cleaned (reblued if they need it),
the springs are greased and, if found necessary, dents
are removed from the shells, base plates are
straightened out and splayed sides replaced in
position, the completed job having to measure up
to gauges specially constructed for each essential
dimension. The results of these periodic overhauls
have been entirely satisfactory and jambs are now
of rare occurrence.

Enough has been said to show that the condition
of the magazine is of the utmost importance to the
reliable functioning of the pistol and at least ordinary
care, therefore, should be exercised it its regard.
Those individuals who use their magazines as screwdrivers,
or to open beer bottles, have no one to blame
but themselves when their pistols refuse to function.
If any doubt exists as to its condition, a magazine
should be regarded as defective until competent
inspection is available. If the doubt is confirmed,
competent inspection will include a rapid-fire test
with the magazine charged to full capacity. A worthwhile
precaution, to keep the spring efficient, is to
remove one or two cartridges whenever circumstances
permit. This applies, of course, to conditions which
necessitate the magazine being kept charged more or
less permanently. Properly treated, there is no
reason why a well-made magazine should not last
twenty years.

No ammunition can be expected to withstand
indefinitely the wear and tear of daily use, which
implies not only carrying it in all weathers but the
frequent loading and unloading of weapons. It
becomes necessary, therefore, first to ascertain the
period for which ammunition may safely remain in
daily use and then to withdraw it from circulation
immediately the limit of that period has been
reached.

Our conclusions in the matter are based upon the
exigencies of the police service of a great city, a
service that functions ceaselessly for twenty-four
hours a day and is maintained by large numbers
of men whom circumstances compel to go armed
with pistols. For a portion of the force, economy
demands a ratio of approximately two weapons to
three men. It is plain that the same men cannot be
on duty all the time and it follows that in the course
of twenty-four hours weapons and ammunition must
be returned at intervals to police stations for subsequent
issue to other men going out on duty. Such
"change-overs," as they are known technically,
occur not less than three times in twenty-four hours.
At each "change-over" safety demands that the
weapons be unloaded, only to be reloaded on issue
to the next men. Apart from the "change-overs,"
which are due to motives of economy, it will be
recognised, too, that event in those cases where
weapons are provided for each individual, a certain
amount of loading and unloading is likely to take
place in the interests of safety. Add now the fact,
mentioned already, that the ammunition is carried
in all weathers and we have a set of circumstances
definitely indicative of hard usage.

Careful records of over fifteen years show that
under these circumstances the extreme length of
time for which automatic pistol ammunition can be
expected to be reliable is four months. Subsequently,
defects begin to be apparent and work out very
steadily at about two rounds per ten thousand. But
for every week thereafter the number of defective
rounds increases with surprising rapidity.

The records referred to show that revolver ammunition
does not measure up to this standard. In point
of fact, the ratio of defects is approximately double
that of automatic pistol ammunition. The reasons
are not far to seek.

The loading and unloading of revolvers imply
much more handling of the ammunition than is the
case with automatic pistols, which carry their
ammunition in box magazines. Here the magazines
receive most of the rough treatment. With all the
care in the world we must expect, too, that occasionally
ammunition will be dropped on the ground,
possibly on the unsympathetic cement floor of a
police station. Such treatment has less effect on
automatic pistol ammunition, with its tightly crimped
jacketed bullets, than on revolver cartridges, particularly
those of large calibre carrying soft lead
bullets. While there may be no noticeable deformation
of the latter, they are more liable to be jarred
loose from the crimping and that is the prelude to
other troubles.

Apart from what may be regarded as inherent
disadvantages in revolver ammunition, careful comparisons
of respective measurements incline us to
the belief that very often somewhat less care is
exercised in its manufacture than is the case with
automatic pistol ammunition. Of sheer necessity,
the latter must conform more rigidly to accepted
standards. Too great a departure from standard
would be revealed very quickly by the automatic
action of the weapon in which it is used, a compelling
factor in the production of reliable ammunition. It
is only fair to add that defects in the automatic
ammunition put out by makers of repute are few
and far between.

The "life" of ammunition is a matter which
merits the most careful attention, particularly when
we have to consider the needs of a service which is
obliged to have a large amount in constant use. In
some cases, too, complications arise from climatic
conditions and distance from the source of supplies.

It is possible to keep ammunition in excellent
condition for a number of years provided that it is
not removed from its cartons and packing-cases and
that common-sense is used in the matter of storage.
Having in mind the needs touched upon in the
preceding paragraph, we prefer, however, not to trust
to reserve supplies kept in stock for a number of
years but to adopt instead what may be described
as a "revolving credit." The tables given in the
Appendix will convey our meaning more clearly, but
we may state here that two basic conditions influence
their construction, viz.:---

- The undesirability of carrying ammunition in daily
  use for more than four months.
- The undesirability of keeping ammunition in stock
  longer than two years.

From this as a starting point, quantities required on
all counts can be estimated.

By means of this "revolving credit" system we
are spared certain anxieties which would occur were
reserve supplies to be kept in stock over a number
of years. With our full supply expended in under
two years, and replenished as necessary, we do not
have to worry about such things as seasonal cracking
or other forms of deterioration in the brass,
deterioration of the smokeless powder charge,
increased pressures due to that deterioration or,
more important still, the reliability of the primers.
We do not waste first-class ammunition on practice
and training shoots, but use only that which we
consider might be no longer reliable.

The reference to the reliability of the primers
should be explained. We have in mind the modern
non-fouling primer. It will be unnecessary for us
to refer to its value in all circumstances, and
particularly those in which the cleaning of weapons
after firing has to be deferred longer than it should
be. Up to date, however, it does not appear to
last as long in adverse climatic conditions as the
old rust-producing type. We admit that we are not
quite sure of this, but while there is any doubt in
the matter we prefer to take no more risks than
we need, and this aspect is fully taken care of by
the "revolving credit."

We think it will be helpful if our system of dealing
with the ammunition supply is closely linked with
the armoury records which should be kept in respect
of both ammunition and weapons.

Practice and training courses are invaluable in
bringing to light any defective ammunition or pistols,
which should be immediately withdrawn and sent to
the armoury for examination.

If the examination reveals ammunition defects
which are not due to ill-usage but to obvious faults
in manufacture, the matter should be taken up with
the makers, full records being kept. As regards the
pistols, there should be a history sheet for each
weapon and on it should be noted the attributed
and actual causes of the defects (sometimes these
differ widely), the repairs effected, the date returned
to service and other appropriate data.

It is true that all this involves a certain amount
of clerical work, but it is more than justified by the
general efficiency which results and it sinks into
insignificance when it is remembered what that
efficiency may mean to men whose lives would
otherwise be needlessly endangered.

- "Revolving Credit" System

The unit quantities given in Table I are approximately
those which have been found to answer our
own purposes, but can be varied, of course, to suit
different needs of the requirements of larger or
smaller numbers of men. For greater simplicity,
Table I is assumed to provide for a force of 1000 men.

.. csv-table:: Table I. Requirements over Twelve Months
   :header: "", "", "Rounds"
   :widths: 24, 6, 6

   "To be carried in daily use by each man, 12 rounds", "x1000", "12,000"
   "Practice and training, 36 rounds per man", "x1000", "36,000"
   "In reserve, 30 rounds per man", "x1000", "30,000"
   "", "", "78,000"

An initial purchase is made of the total quantity
indicated by Table I as required over a period of
twelve months and, for added clarity, we shall assume
that it is on hand at the end of December.

.. csv-table:: Table II. Disposal of Initial Purchase
   :header: "", "Rounds"
   :widths: 24, 6

   "*1st January*---", ""
   "Place to reserve", "30,000"
   "Issue for daily use", "12,000"
   "Issue for training and practice", "12,000"
   "*1st May*---", ""
   "| Withdraw 12,000 issued 1st January
   | (for daily issue) and use for
   | training and practice. Replace for
   | daily use, by fresh issue of", "12,000"
   "*1st September*---", ""
   "| Withdraw 12,000 issued 1st May
   | (for daily use) and use for
   | training and practice. Replace for
   | daily use, by fresh issue of", "12,000"
   "", "78,000"

In twelve months, therefore, 36,000 rounds have
been actually expended in training and practice.

Meanwhile, a second but smaller purchase has been
made and is on hand at the end of December, twelve
months after the first purchase arrived, so that the
stock of ammunition is as shown in the next table.

.. csv-table:: Table III. Stock at end of First Twelve Months
   :header: "", "Rounds"
   :widths: 24, 6

   "In reserve", "30,000"
   "In daily use (issued 1st September)", "30,000"
   "Amount of second purchase", "30,000"
   "", "78,000"

We commence the second year with a stock of the
same quantity as that with which we began originally
and so  are able to repeat exactly the processes of
the first year.

There is one difference to be noted, however. The
second purchase is not drawn on until the first is
exhausted. Thus on 1st January of the second year,
12,000 rounds, issued for daily use at the beginning
of the preceding September, are withdrawn and
issued for training and practice, their place being
taken by 12,000 from reserve. The May issue,
12,000, and half the September issue, 6000, completely
exhausted the 30,000 originally placed to
reserve.

Our two basic conditions are therefore fulfilled, *i.e.*:

- No ammunition in daily use longer than
  four months.
- No ammunition in stock longer than two years.

As long as the programme is adhered to, the
processes outlined are merely a matter of repetition
year after year.

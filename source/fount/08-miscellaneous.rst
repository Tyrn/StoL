- Holsters.
- Care and Cleaning of Pistols.

Holsters for service men who are required to carry
a pistol openly while in uniform must obviously be
of a standard pattern, and there is little room for all
the refinements that to to the making of a really good
holster where individual requirements are the only
consideration.

Nevertheless, the design of service holsters might
well be given a little more thought than is often the
case. It is not possible, perhaps, to combine service
needs with the facilities for the lightning-quick draw
which some special designs provide, but there are
one or two things that can be done to help in the
latter respect. The butt of the pistol should protrude
from the holster sufficiently to allow the user to get
it well into his hand as quickly as possible; there
should be no fumbling. If there is, there is something
radically wrong with the design. The front of the
holster should be cut away to allow the forefinger
to enter the trigger-guard without resistance and
without the stubbing of the finger-nail on the leather
that is so often noticed. The gun can be secured in
the holster either by a flap or a strap, both fastening
on a metal stud. The strap is, of course, no wider
than it must be to effect its
purpose. The flap offers better
protection from the weather,
and we do not think its greater
width makes any real difference
to the speed with which the
pistol can be drawn. The
bottom of the holster should
be open so that is case of rain
or accidental immersion the
water does not remain inside
and the holster can dry out
more quickly. The bottom of
the holster cannot be entirely
open if the design of the pistol
is such that it will slip too far
down, but it is always possible
to leave an aperture or apertures
of adequate size for
draining.

There remains to be considered
the position in which
the holster should be worn.
The writers have a preference
for wearing the gun on the
belt at the left side of the
body. In that position (see
Fig. 20) the wearer is able to
draw his pistol at reasonable
speed, and apart from those
occasions when he is obliged to shoot, he can
protect it with his left hand and forearm from
attempts to snatch it from the holster. Policemen
find that such attempts are by no means infrequent
in a crowd or on the part of "drunks"
resisting arrest. To guard further against this
danger (and it may well be serious), we recommend
the use of a stout lanyard attached at one
end to the swivel in the pistol butt. The other end
should pass in a loop over the right shoulder, the
shoulder strap of the uniform preventing the lanyard
from slipping off. Never wear the lanyard round the
neck, as we have sometimes seen it done, for needless
to say, such a practice is liable to add to the danger
very considerably.

Whatever the position in which the holster is worn,
great care should be taken to ensure that its design
and method of attachment to the belt provide the
maximum of resistance when the pistol is drawn. To
make our meaning clearer, the pistol should slip
easily out of the holster, but the holster itself should
remain as nearly immovable as possible. Otherwise,
when the pistol is drawn, the holster has a tendency to
accompany it, and the result is a slow and clumsy
draw. With a holster worn on the right thigh, the
necessary amount of resistance may have to be
provided by a thong or string fastened to the bottom
of the holster and tied round the leg. Though so far
we have been referring solely to holsters to be worn
openly when in uniform, it will be obvious that the
necessity for resistance exists for all other holsters
as well.

Turning now to holsters for other purposes, we
strongly recommend the reader to be satisfied only
with the best and to take any amount of trouble in
order to get it.

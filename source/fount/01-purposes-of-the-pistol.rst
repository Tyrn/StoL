I. Purposes of the Pistol
=========================

By "Pistol" is meant any one-hand gun. This book
is concerned with two types only: (1) pistols with
revolving cylinders carrying several cartridges, and
(2) self-loading magazine pistols. For convenience,
the former will be referred to henceforth as
"revolvers" and the latter as "automatics." The
word "revolver" has long been accepted by dictionaries
in almost every language. If "automatic"
has not yet been quite so widely accepted, it is, we
think, well on the way to being so, and we shall not
be anticipating matters unduly if we continue to use
it in the sense indicated.

Excluding duelling (since it is forbidden in most
countries and appears to be declining in favour even
in those countries in which it is permitted tacitly or
otherwise), there seem to remain two primary and
quite distinct uses for the pistol. The first of those
uses is for target shooting (i.e. *deliberate* shooting
with a view to getting all shots in the ten-ring on a
stationary target). Its second use is as a weapon
of combat.

This book is concerned solely with the latter aspect,
but it must not be inferred on that account that we
in any way decry the sport of target shooting. On
the contrary, we admire the high degree of skill for
which it calls and which we personally cannot emulate.
We recognise the great amount of patient practice
necessary to attain such skill, and we can see that
in suitable circumstances the inclusion of a target
pistol in the camper's equipment would not only be
a source of pleasure but might be useful as well.
Target shooting has its place and we have no quarrel
with it.

There probably will be a quarrel, however, when
we go on to say that beyond helping to teach care in
the handling of fire-arms, target shooting is of no
value whatever in learning the use of the pistol as
a weapon of combat. The two things are as different
from each other as chalk from cheese, and what has
been learned from target shooting is best unlearned
if proficiency is desired in the use of the pistol under
actual fighting conditions.

These views are the outcome of many years of
carefully recorded experience with the Police Force
of a semi-Oriental city in which, by reason of local
conditions that are unusual and in some respects
unique, armed crime flourishes to a degree that we
think must be unequalled anywhere else in the world.
That experience includes not only armed encounters
but the responsibility for instructing large numbers
of police in those methods of pistol shooting which
have been thought best calculated to bring results
in the many shooting affrays in which they are called
upon to take part.

There are many who will regard our views as rank
heresy, or worse. We shall be content for the present,
however, if in the light of the preceding paragraph
we may be conceded at least a title to those views,
and we shall hope to fortify the title subsequently
by statistics of actual results of shooting affrays over
a number of years.

At this point it would be advisable to examine very
carefully the conditions under which we may expect
the pistol to be used, regarding it only as a combat
weapon. Personal experience will tend perhaps to
make us regard these conditions primarily from the
policeman's point of view, but a great many of them
must apply equally, we think, to military and other
requirements in circumstances which preclude the
use of a better weapon that the pistol---that is to
say, when it is impracticable to use a shot-gun, rifle
of sub-machine gun.

In the great majority of shooting affrays the
distance at which firing takes place is not more
than four yards. Very frequently it is considerably
less. Often the only warning of what is about to
take place is a suspicious movement of an opponent's
hand. Again, your opponent is quite likely to be
on the move. It may happen, too, that you have been
running in order to overtake him. If you have had
reason to believe that shooting is likely, you will be
keyed-up to the highest pitch and will be grasping
your pistol with almost convulsive force. If you
have to fire, your instinct will be to do so as quickly
as possible, and you will probably do it with a bent
arm, possibly even from the level of the hip. The
whole affair may take place in a bad light of none
at all, and that is precisely the moment when the
policeman, at any rate, is most likely to meet trouble,
since darkness favours the activities of the criminal.
It may be that a bullet whizzes past you and that
you will experience the momentary stupefaction
which is due to the shock of the explosion at very
short range of the shot just fired by your opponent---a
very different feeling, we can assure you, from
that experienced when you are standing behind or
alongside a pistol that is being fired. Finally, you
may find that you have to shoot from some
awkward position, not necessarily even while on
your feet.

There is no exaggeration in this analysis of fighting
conditions. Here we have a set of circumstances
which in every respect are absolutely different
from those encountered in target shooting. Do
they not call for absolutely different methods of
training?

To answer this question, we must consider the
essential points which emerge from our analysis.
They appear in the following order:---

1. Extreme speed, both in drawing and firing.
2. Instinctive, as opposed to deliberate aim.
3. Practice under circumstances which approximate
   as nearly as possible to actual fighting conditions.

In commenting on the first essential, let us say that
the necessity for speed is vital and can never be
sufficiently emphasised. The average shooting affray
is a matter of split seconds. If you take much longer
than a third of a second to fire your first shot, you
will not be the one to tell the newspapers about it.
It is literally a matter of the quick and the dead.
Take your choice.

Instinctive aiming, the second essential, is an
entirely logical consequence of the extreme speed to
which we attach so much importance. That is so
for the simple reason that there is no time for any
of the customary aids to accuracy. If reliance on
those aids has become habitual, so much the worse
for you if you are shooting to live. There is no time,
for instance, to put your self into some special stance
or to align the sights of the pistol, and any attempt
to do so places you at the mercy of a quicker opponent.
In any case, the sights would be of little use if the
light were bad, and none at all if it were dark, as might
easily happen. Would it not be wiser, therefore, to
face facts squarely and set to work to find out how
best to develop instinctive aiming to the point of
getting results under combat conditions?

It *can* be done and it is not so very difficult.

Everyone is familiar with the fact that he can
point his forefinger accurately at an object at which
he happens to be looking. It is just as easy, moreover,
to do so without raising the hand so high as the
level of the eyes. That he can do so may be
coordination of eye and hand or just plain instinct,
call it what you will.

Please try this little experiment while sitting at
your desk. Imagine that you are holding a pistol in
your right hand. Sitting squarely and keeping both
eyes open, raise your hand from the level of the
desk, but not so high as the level of your eyes, and
with a straight arm point your extended forefinger
at a mark directly in front of you on the opposite
wall. Observe carefully now what has taken place.
Your forefinger, as intended, will be pointing to the
mark which you are facing squarely, and the back of
your hand will be vertical, as it would be if it
actually held a pistol. You will observe also that
you have brought your arm across you until your
hand is approximately in alignment with the vertical
centre-line of your body and that, under the directing
impulse of the master-eye, your hand will be bent from
the wrist towards the right.

The elements of that little experiment form the
basis of the training system which is elaborated in
succeeding chapters. We cannot claim that the
system produces nail-driving marksmanship, but
that is not what we look for. We want the ability
to hit with extreme speed man-sized targets at very
short ranges under the difficult circumstances which
have been outlined already. Nail-driving marksmanship
will not cope with such conditions.

In this training system nothing is permitted to
interfere with the development of speed. For that
reason we have steadily set our faces against competitions
or rewards of any kind. The instant that
competitions, with the accompanying medals, badges,
etc. are introduced, men will try to shoot deliberately,
whether consciously or not and we find our object
is being defeated.

For long shots, and they are necessary occasionally,
different methods must be employed; but even for
long shots speed must still be regarded as essential,
and any tendency to deliberate shooting should be
discouraged by such means as the exposure of the
targets for very brief periods only.

The theories involved in the square stance, the
position of the pistol in line with the vertical centre
of the body, and the hand bent over to the right
have proved in practice to be of immense assistance
in the development of the desired standard of
accuracy when shooting at speed. Though still very
willing to learn, the authors doubt now whether any
other methods would answer the particular purposes
in view. In general, the training system given in this
book may fairly be said to have achieved its object,
but perhaps it is time now for the promised statistics
to play their part in the discussion.

The records of the particular police force of the
semi-Oriental city referred to earlier show that the
force, consistently trained in the methods of this
book, has to its credit in twelve and a half years no
less than 666 armed encounters with criminals. The
following table, referring only to encounters in
which *pistols* were used by the police, gives the
results:---

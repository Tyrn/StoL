II. Choosing a Pistol
=====================

We open this chapter with a warning.

Without an adequate knowledge of its use, there
can be few things so purposeless and dangerous as
a pistol. Adequate knowledge comes only from
competent instruction. If you have never received
such instruction and are not prepared to do so, do
not buy a pistol, or if you own one already, surrender
it to the police. That will help to lighten the burden
of their cares.

We shall assume, however, that our readers are
sufficiently interested to recognise that the possession
of a pistol and efficiency in its use should go hand-in-hand.
For them, the starting point in choosing a
pistol should be to buy the best they can afford for
the particular purpose in view. If a pistol is needed
at all it may be needed very badly indeed, and poor
quality contributes nothing to either safety or peace
of mind.

The type of pistol to be chosen depends on
the use to which it is to be put. A pistol that
meets the needs of the detective or plain-clothes
man, for instance, is not necessarily suitable for
individual self-defence or for the uniformed service
man.

Let us consider first the case of the detective or
plain-clothes man. Here the weapon must be carried
concealed and the wearer must be prepared for the
quickest of quick draws and an instantaneous first
shot, most probably at very close quarters. For that
purpose, our own choice would be a cut-down revolver
of heavy calibre. Fig. 22 (b) will show you
better than any description what we mean.

The weapon shown in the illustration started life
as a .45 Colt New Service double-action revolver
with a 5-inch barrel. The hammer spur has been
cut off, the barrel length reduced to 2 inches, the
front part of the trigger-guard has been removed,
and grooves have been cut on the left side of the
butt for the middle, third and little fingers.

Now for the reasons for this drastic treatment.
The big New Service revolver was chosen, primarily,
because the butt is of adequate size for the average
man's hand to grasp in a hurry without any fumbling.
Secondly, it is one of the most powerful weapons
possible to obtain.

The removal of the hammer spur and the
smoothing over of what remains prevent the weapon
from catching in the clothing when drawn in a
violent hurry. As the hammer cannot be cocked
by the thumb, the weapon has to be fired by a
continuous pull on the trigger. With a sufficiency
of practice, very fast shooting is rendered possible
by this method.

The shortening of the barrel is for speed in drawing.
Obviously, it takes less time for 2 inches of barrel
to emerge from the holster than 5 inches. Contrary
to what might be expected, there is no loss of
accuracy, at any rate at the ranges at which the
weapon is customarily used.

The front part of the trigger-guard is removed in
order to eliminate yet another possible cause of
fumbling when speed is the order of the day. The
index-finger, no matter of what length of thickness,
wraps itself in the proper position round the trigger
without any impediment whatever. The grooves on
the butt are there to ensure that the fingers grip
the weapon in exactly the same way every time.

Lest it be thought that we are the originators
of this fearsome but eminently practical weapon,
let us say at once that we are not. We owe the
idea to a book by Mr J. H. Fitzgerald of the Colt's
Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company, and we
gladly acknowledge our indebtedness.

For a weapon to be carried openly by uniformed
police and officers and men of the fighting services,
we unhesitatingly avow or preference for the
automatic pistol. We shall treat it as a matter
of personal preference and shall not abuse the
supporters of the revolver for having other views.
They are quite welcome to those views and we
trust we may be allowed to retain ours. We shall
do so, in any case, until we have good reason to
alter them.

We are familiar with the criticisms so often made
of the automatic pistol. It is said that it is unreliable,
will often jamb without provocation and
certainly will do so if mud, sand or water gets into
the mechanism, and above all, it is not safe.

There have been and possibly still are automatics
like that, but one is not obliged to use them.

We think it is only in Great Britain that the
reliability of the automatic is still questioned. In
the United States, while many people adhere to
their preference for the revolver, we have never
heard any doubts expressed in the matter, and it is
worthy of note that both there and in Germany the
automatic has long been in use as a standard weapon
of the fighting services.

There are in existence types of automatic pistols
which are perfectly reliable. We base this statement
on our actual experience of them over a period of
twenty years. That experience includes an intimate
knowledge of a service consisting of over six thousand
men, most of them armed with automatics and having
a surprising record of shooting affrays to their credit.
If their weapons had been in any way unsatisfactory,
twenty years should have sufficed to reveal the
defects. But in all that time nothing has occurred,
either in the training of the service referred to or
in the affrays in which the service has taken part,
to cast the slightest doubt on the reliability of the
automatic, nor has there been a single instance of
injury or death due to accident.

Apart from the question of reliability, we have
found that in comparison with the revolver, the
automatic offers the following advantages:---

- It is easier and quicker to recharge.
- It can be fired at far greater speed.
- It is easier to shoot with.

The first point will be readily conceded but the
other two may meet with opposition.

It is probably the case that, *for the first shot*, the
cut-down revolver which has been described is
fractionally quicker, but for subsequent shots the
rate of fire of the automatic is much higher. A
great deal of the recoil is absorbed in the operation
of the mechanism and the trigger pull is much
shorter and easier than that of the revolver. We
refer, of course, to the use of the double-action
revolver. If the hammer were to be cocked for
each shot, the rate of fire would be funereal by
comparison. A skilled shot can do excellent work
with the automatic even while making it sound like
a machine gun.

It seems to follow logically that the absorption of
so much of the recoil, combined with the shorter
trigger-pull, furnish theoretical proof of our contention
that the automatic is easier to shoot with.
Practical proof of our contention is found in the
training results. Critical observation has demonstrated
that a beginner can be trained in the use
of the automatic in a third of the time and with
the expenditure of less than half the ammunition
required for the revolver. Furthermore, once trained
in the use of the automatic, men appear definitely
to need less subsequent practice to maintain the
standard of shooting which has been attained in the
course of training.

We shall endeavour to throw more light on this
subject in the chapters on training methods, and by
way of preface to those chapters we must introduce
and describe one more point in connection with the
automatic, and this time we shall certainly be accused
of heresy.

We have an inveterate dislike of the profusion of
safety devices with which all automatic pistols are
regularly equipped. We believe them to be the
cause of more accidents than anything else. There
are too many instances on record of men being shot
by accident either because the safety-catch was in
the firing position when it ought not to have been
or because it was in the safe position when that
was the last thing to be desired. It is better, we
think, to make the pistol permanently "unsafe"
and then to devise such methods of handling it that
there will  be no accidents. One of the essentials of
the instruction courses which follow is that the
pistols used shall have their side safety-catches
permanently pinned down in the firing or "unsafe"
position. How this matter is taken care of is described
at length in Chapter III. Suffice it to say here
that our unorthodox methods have been subjected
to the acid test of many years of particularly
exacting conditions and have not been found
wanting.

Having dealt with weapons suited to the detective
or plain-clothes man and the uniformed services
respectively, there remains the case of the private
individual who wishes to carry a gun. In most
countries it is illegal to do so and we have no wish
to encourage law-breaking. Nevertheless, there are
still some countries and circumstances in which it
may be necessary and advisable for the private
individual to go armed.

Our recommendation to the private individual who
can justifiably claim the right to carry a pistol is
to buy an automatic and carry it in a shoulder
holster such as is described in a succeeding chapter.
We are not greatly in favour of small weapons.
No small weapon can possess the strength and
reliability of a large one. The material and workmanship
may be as good but the margins of tolerance
are too small to provide the absolute reliability
which is so desirable. We recommend the automatic
of good size and calibre partly because we are assured
of its reliability and partly because of its shape.
It does not "bulge" like the revolver and therefore
is less noticeable (we are presuming that the private
individual will carry his pistol concealed). Do not
forget the obligation which you are under to make
yourself thoroughly safe and efficient with the
weapon of your choice.

We are often asked what is the best weapon to
have in the house for purely protective purposes.
Most of the people who make this enquiry know
little of fire-arms and say so quite frankly. It usually
happens, too, that they have neither the intention
nor the opportunity to make themselves efficient with
any kind of one-hand gun. If they are of this type,
we are convinced that they would be better off with
a good watch-dog, or even a police-whistle. There
are, however, many men whose knowledge of firearms
is limited to the shot-gun, in the use of which
they are both proficient and reliable. If this type
of man insists on possessing some kind of weapon
"to keep in the house" we would recommend him
to acquire a "sawn-off" shot gun, with external
hammers of the re-bounding type and barrels of about
18 inches in length. The ease with which it can be
manipulated, the accuracy with which it can be
aimed, either from the shoulder or the hip, and the
spread of the shot charge combine to make it a
much safer and more efficient weapon than any kind
of one-hand gun in the use of which he is not
proficient.

Introduction
============

After the successful retreat of the British Expeditionary
force from the shores of Dunkirk in 1940,
England began a period of reorganizing its army and
strengthening the home guard against the expected
German, cross channel invasion. At the same time,
training in commando and para military type operations
was initiated.

Experts in close quarter fighting techniques, and
training, were assembled from all over the commonwealth
and allied sources. By the time of Pearl Harbor
the most skilled and famous of these men were also
engaged in training special intelligence personnel for
operations in enemy occupied territory. Schools were
operated under tight security conditions all over the
English countryside and in Northern Scotland where
country estates of the nobility were used as training
centers.

In 1942 the U. S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS)
under command of Colonel "Wild Bill" Donovan began
its program and buildup for similar clandestine operations,
with its own personnel, when the main thrust of
American military might was ready to aid the allies in
retaking occupied Europe. Captain W. E. "Dan" Fairbairn
was attached to the OSS for training purposes. The
writer, a very willing, "eager beaver" lieutenant, was
assigned to him as an assistant for a one year period that
was followed by a special duty assignment of the same
nature with E. A. "Bill" Sykes in Scotland near the
British Commando training center.

By actual records, both Fairbairn and Sykes while
with the Shanghai police engaged in over two hundred
incidents where violent close combat occurred with
oriental criminal elements. These battle scarred veterans
were experts in all types of close quarter fighting with
and without weapons. Their training techniques and
methods were proven first in the back alleys of Shanghai
and later with the Commando and the Special Intelligence
branches of both the British and U. S. Services.

*Shooting to Live* was the first written manual to
surface in the field of combat pistol shooting. Its
principles and techniques were expanded and modified
upon to fit American needs in the various editions of the
writer's own text, *Kill or Get Killed*. Many present day
U. S. military and law enforcement combat handgun
shooting techniques can be traced back to this book.

A Note from the Publisher
=========================

The toughest city in the world was Shanghai. The
time was the 1930s. The streets were ruled by gangs.
Violent gang wars, murder, rape, and robbery were The
order of the day. The night belonged to roaming gangs
of toughs. In charge of the Shanghai Municipal Police,
Capt. W. E. Fairbairn and his partner, Capt. Eric Anthony
Sykes, were determined to reclaim the streets
for the citizenry.

*Shooting to Live* is the product of Fairbairn's and
Syke's *practical* experience with the handgun. Hundreds
of incidents provided the basis for the first true book on
life-or-death shootouts with the pistol. *Shooting to Live*
teaches, in clear, concise terms, all concepts, considerations,
and applications of *combat pistolcraft*. The methods
taught here provided the basis for all the later
masters---Applegate, Weaver, Cooper, Taylor, Chapman,
Farnham, Hackathorn, et al. This all-time classic book on
combat pistol shooting is a must for the serious shooter.

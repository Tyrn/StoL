Preface
=======

It may be said that there is already a sufficiency of
books on the one-hand gun and its uses. Some
justification for an addition to the list might be
considered to exist if the subject could be presented
from a different angle, and that is what is now
attempted.

*Shooting to Live* describes methods developed and
practiced during an eventful quarter of a century and
adopted, in spite of their unorthodoxy, by one
police organisation after another in the Far East and
elsewhere. It is the authors' hope that their relation
of these methods may contribute to the efficiency,
and therefore safety, of those whose lot it is to use
the one-hand gun in the course of duty.
